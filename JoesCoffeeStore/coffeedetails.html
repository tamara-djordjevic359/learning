                <p class="productarticledescription">We designed The Daily to be a balanced and approachable drip coffee, drinkable every day yet complex enough to keep you coming back.

                    The Daily is built around seasonally fresh components, typically coffees from South and Central America, chosen carefully to bring together our favorite attributes in coffee, from brightness to body, sweetness to finish. Currently, The Daily is made up of a coffee from Nicaragua, and provides everything we look for in a satisfying, drink-every-day blend.</p>
